            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p>I just started learning to code this year 2024 again, I was coding back 2020 since 
                I just had to do it for my thesis project and stopped during mid 2021 as I started working
                in a non-IT related office job. I plan to explore on to the field of IT. Particularly,
                on web development as for my job in the future. That's why I practice coding everyday.
